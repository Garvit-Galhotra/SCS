# var, let, const

let is to be used not var 

and let is fixing something... (will talk later about that one...)

and const is used when we dont want to change the value later of that particular variable

# console....

console.log(); 
console.info();
~~                                                                                                                                                        ~~

Both of them are mostly same but the only thing is that ..... in `some` browser info one has the i written on it in front of it ..

~~                                                                                                                                                        ~~
console.warn("asjdaij");
console.error("dawda");

~~                                                                                                                                                        ~~

the above two is used for the developers when they are testing the js part of the website...

# string 

"" -> everything written in this is a string..
`` -> Backticks used to variable kinda like a f string in python 
`this is the use of backtick ${here-will-be-the-variable}`
